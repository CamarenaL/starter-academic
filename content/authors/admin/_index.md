My research agenda addresses both established and emerging issues related to public management, nonprofit management, and local government. My research focuses broadly on representation, leadership, gender, and diversity in public and nonprofit organizations. I've published in some of the following journals: Review of Public Personnel Administration, Local Government Studies, and American Journal of Engineering Education.

Prior to entering academia, I worked as a Policy Analyst at Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc., a 501(c)3 community development corporation in Arizona.
